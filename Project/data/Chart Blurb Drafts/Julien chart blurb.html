Comparing the share of global greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2010, it is observable that there has been marginal change in which nations emit the highest amount of gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Being post-industrial nations (United States, EU countries, Russia, Japan) this has consistently been the trend for the last 20 years.
