  Production of fossil fuels correlates with greenhouse gas emissions much more closely than imports or exports. <br/><br/>

  Production values are much more correlated with each other than exports and imports are

  <a> Eiko:</a>During the '90s, Russian crude oil production decreased significantly. Then, beginning in the year 2000, their production rates soared and have continued to increase to this day. <br/><br/>
  American crude oil production declined steadily from 1990 until 2008. Then, beginning during the 2008 recession, American crude oil production picked up, with production rates soaring and continuing to soar to the present day.
  Otherwise, following 2000 most other UN countries (with the exception of Canada) have experienced a general decline in crude oil production.

<a> Julien:</a>Comparing the share of global greenhouse gas emissions from 2000 to 2010, it is observable that there has been marginal change in which nations emit the highest amount of gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Being post-industrial nations (United States, EU countries, Russia, Japan) this has consistently been the trend for the last 20 years.

  <a> Sasha:</a>The hard coal production of the US has been declining rapidly since 1980, and their greenhouse gas emissions have also decreased over that time. Other nations like Russia that have increased their hard coal production have seen an increase in their emissions over the same time, showing that emissions are correlated with the hard coal production of a nation.
