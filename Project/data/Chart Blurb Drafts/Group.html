  Production of fossil fuels correlates with greenhouse gas emissions much more closely than imports or exports. <br/><br/>
  Production values are much more correlated with each other than exports and imports are

  During the '90s, Russian crude oil production decreased significantly. Then, beginning in the year 2000, their production rates soared and have continued to increase to this day. <br/><br/>
  Similarly, American crude oil production declined steadily from 1990 until the 2000s. Then, following the 2008 recession, American crude oil production picked up, with production rates soaring and steadily growing to present day. <br/><br/>
  Otherwise, following 2000 most other UN countries (with the exception of Canada) have experienced a general decline in crude oil production. This shift may be the result of increased regulation, a shift to other fuels, or an increased reliance on Russian or US crude oil export.

Comparing the share of global greenhouse gas emissions of 1999-2009-2019, it is observable that there has been marginal change in which nations emit the highest amount of gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Being post-industrial and industrial nations (United States, EU countries, Russia, Japan) this has consistently been the trend for the last 20 years.

<br/><br/>This violin plot shows that, in each shown year, there are two significant high outliers and then a clustering for the rest of the datapoints. The two outliers near the top, those being the United States and the EU, have significantly decreased the amount of GHG emitted, while the third highest nation, that being Russia, has increased drastically.<br/>

  The hard coal production of the US has been declining rapidly since 1980, and their greenhouse gas emissions have also decreased over that time. Other nations like Russia that have increased their hard coal production have seen an increase in their emissions over the same time, showing that emissions are correlated with the hard coal production of a nation.
