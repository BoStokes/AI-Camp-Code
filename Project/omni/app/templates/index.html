                  For our mission, we chose to investigate and attempt to predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on their relations ship to import, export, and production rates of different fossil fuels. Given recent events surrounding fossil fuels, e.g., embargoes and skyrocketing prices, we felt that this was a very topical and relevant project to pursue. Our hypothesis was that GHG emissions are positively related to fossil fuel emissions. However, this has been well studied and proven in the past, so we were also interested in understanding nuances of the relationship at a deeper level.

                  Decribe the project here. Hypothesis. Include Motivation, tech

                  Comparing the share of global greenhouse gas emissions of
                  1999-2009-2019, it is observable that there has been marginal
                  change in which nations emit the highest amount of gasses such
                  as
                  <br />
                  carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Being
                  post-industrial and industrial nations (United States, EU

                  for the last 20 years.
                  <br />This also allows us to see what are the limits to the
                  dataset we are using. For example, China is not included in
                  this dataset and is a large contributor to global emmissions.

                  The hard coal production of the US has declined steadily since

                  over that time. Meanwhile, Russia and Australia, two nations
                  that have greatly increased their hard coal production have
                  seen a large increase in their emissions over the same time,
                  highlighting the trend seen in the heatmap that emissions are
                  highly correlated with the hard coal production of a nation.

                  During the '90s, Russian crude oil production decreased
                  significantly. Then, from 2000 to 2004 their production rates
                  soared. Ever since, their production rates have continued to
                  increase at a slightly slower rate. <br /><br />
                  Similarly, American crude oil production declined steadily
                  from 1990 until the 2000s. Then, following the 2008 recession,
                  American crude oil production picked up, with production rates
                  soaring and steadily growing to present day. <br /><br />
                  Otherwise, following 2000 most other UN countries (with the
                  exception of Canada) have experienced a general decline in
                  crude oil production. This shift may be the result of
                  increased regulation, a shift to other fuels, or an increased
                  reliance on Russian or US crude oil export.

                        Lasso Regression is a supervised machine learning model that uses L1 regularization to penalize weights of uninformative features by forcing them to be 0. This is in contrast with Ridge Regression which uses L2 to complete the same function. After training the model on our data, we found that there were better models that proved to be more accurate in comparison. After hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, it was found that the alpha had the greatest impact on the accuracy of the model. With an alpha of 0.0001, our resulting model produced an r2 of .9908 and an MSE of 4.58772e-04.

                        The linear regression model is an example of supervised machine learning. It utilizes independent variables (input features) to predict the dependent variable (target variable) by creating a special linear line. This is the line of best fit, where the residual (error) between the actual values and the predicted values are at their lowest. In our application of the model, we received a mean squared error of 0.0004449381082682105 (4.44938e-04) and an r^2 of 0.98083.

                        In essence, Elastic Net is the intersect between a Lasso and a Ridge regression. Normally, a Lasso model will tend to rely on a single variable, simply removing variables it deems unnecessary, while a Ridge model will shrink a variable's weight to near epsilon. Elastic Net integrates both of these techniques and is useful when handling data with millions of parameters.

                        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning model that uses the distance between nearby points to make predictions. For the input, the k nearest points are taken where k is a whole number. The output is the average value of these points. The hyperparemeters we tuned for this model are the k value and the weights. Using GridSearchCV, we found the best value for k to be 2 and the best weighting to be distance. Using these hyperparameters, we got an MSE of 6.089e-05 and an r^2 of 0.9964

                        The Random Forest model for machine learning is based on a structure known as a Decision Tree. Decision Trees take data and classify it by running through a series of decisions, with each branch representing a different outcome. You continue to follow the tree until there are no more decisions to be made, at which point you reach a leaf, which is a final conclusion reached regarding the data. A Random Forest model uses a multitude of randomly generated Decision Trees (hence the name, <i>Random Forest</i>) simultaneously on the same datapoint and averages the leaf responses of each tree to reach a final answer. It is often considered superior to a single Decision Tree model because it uses a large sample of trees to increase precision and zero in on a target value.

                  Above are our six different machine learning models that have
                  varying accuracy in their predictions. Using Greenhouse Gas
                  Emissions (GHG) as the target variable, this provided us with
                  10 different feature variables such as import, exports, and
                  production of different energy sources to see which had the
                  greatest impact and correlation to GHG. Having pre-labeled
                  data from the UN, a supervised machine learning model fits the
                  goals that we set out on this project. Different forms of
                  regression were used as we wanted to predict a continuous
                  value, yet these had the greatest variance in accuracy of our
                  models. The two that would be used to make the most accurate
                  predictions were the Random Forest Regression and the Neural
                  Network which we built using TensorFlow: 1. Random Forest
                  Regression MSE: 1.5923508e-05, 2. Neural Net MSE:
                  7.0015085e-05. These performed an order of magnitude better than our
                  other models which were all in the range of
                  (e-03&ltMSE&lte-04).
